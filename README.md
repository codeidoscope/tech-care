# tech-care
A list of resources for taking care of yourself when you work in tech

-----

## What's tech-care?

tech-care is a collection of resources put together to help people working in
tech find relief in moments of struggles.

## How do I contribute?

### Contributing resources
Simply open a [pull request](https://github.com/codeidoscope/tech-care/compare)
 with the resource you think would be beneficial to others. The format is as follow:

`[Name of resource](path/to/resource) - Short description of the resource *[Type of subscription]*`

i.e.

[Example Resource](http://www.example.come) - A resource to help you understand
the format. *[Free]*

If you would like to add resources specific to your country, please open a PR
to create a specific page in the format `countrycode-resources.md` i.e. `fr-resources.md` for France, or `bz-resources.md` for Belize.

The two-letters country code should follow the [ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1)
standard format.

**There are existing templates for each page and item in the `/templates` folder.**


### Contributing experience
- If you have worked in the field of social work or psychology/psychiatry or
other mental health-related fields and you have advice on how to better
structure this page, present information or format the language, please open a
[new issue](https://github.com/codeidoscope/tech-care/issues/new) describing
your issue and solution.

- If you have experience in managing repositories of knowledge and have ideas
and suggestions to improve the presentation, maintainability and ease of access,
please open a [new issue](https://github.com/codeidoscope/tech-care/issues/new)
describing your issue and solution.

### Contributing translation
- While English is a fine language to get started in, not all tech workers work
in English, and it would be great to have this repository translated so that
non-English speakers can also benefit from it. If you feel confident that you
can provide an accurate translation, please submit a
[pull request](https://github.com/codeidoscope/tech-care/compare) with the translation.

## How is it organised?

At the moment, there is one list of resources, and different pages for countries.
 In the future, I'd like for that list to be expanded, and hopefully turned into a website.
